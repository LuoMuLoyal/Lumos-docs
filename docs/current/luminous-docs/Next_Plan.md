# Luminous Next Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-12

This file records the next implementation order only. Completed work belongs in `MigrationLog.md`; current facts belong in `Current_State.md`.

## Current Goal

Use the Product_Vision-converged five-tab mobile UI as the baseline, then move into real daily health loops without presenting mock or deferred features as real capability.

## Immediate Work Order

1. **AI boundary confirmation before next slice**
   - Execution plan reference:
     - `Luminous/plans/2026-06-12-remaining-backlog.md` (WS5)
   - Core boundary decisions already recorded in both repos:
     - keep bounded linear flows for manual Today / weekly / monthly summaries as default
     - introduce tool-capable orchestrator only when branching / retrieval / multi-step tool use becomes real
     - do not refactor shipped Today + weekly manual paths into agent runtime
   - Remaining gaps before starting the next AI slice:
     - define one shared locale-aware prompt/copy helper in Lucent as the entry point for future weekly summary, monthly summary, candidate-record NLP, and screenshot-analysis modules

2. **Local full-stack lane usage rule**
   - Keep the current Record lane out of GitHub Actions for now.
   - Owner command for manual verification:
     - backend shell:
       `cd Lucent`
       `pnpm dev:stack:up`
       `pnpm db:migrate:test`
       `pnpm start:test:dev`
     - frontend shell:
       `cd Luminous`
       `flutter test integration_test/record/fullstack_record_lane_test.dart -d emulator-5554 --dart-define=LUCENT_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000 --dart-define=E2E_TEST_EMAIL=fullstack-record-lane@example.com --dart-define=E2E_TEST_PASSWORD=RecordLane123 --dart-define=E2E_RECORD_DATE=2026-06-12`
      - frontend shell:
        `flutter test integration_test/app/fullstack_today_report_lane_test.dart -d emulator-5554 --dart-define=LUCENT_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000 --dart-define=E2E_TEST_EMAIL=fullstack-record-lane@example.com --dart-define=E2E_TEST_PASSWORD=RecordLane123 --dart-define=E2E_RECORD_DATE=2026-06-12`
   - Because `integration_test/` now lives in nested feature folders, always run those tests with an explicit file path and explicit device id. Plain `flutter test integration_test` is ambiguous when desktop/web targets are also available.
   - Expected run timing:
     - before merging any change that touches auth/session restore
     - before merging any Lucent or Luminous change that touches Today or Report protected root-tab loading
     - before merging any Lucent or Luminous change that touches `/api/v1/user/daily-records*`
     - before merging changes to the full-stack E2E helper or generated auth/record client surface
     - before cutting a mobile test build that claims Record CRUD is stable

3. **AI follow-up order after Today**
   - Continue in this order after the manual Today + weekly report paths are stable:
     - monthly AI summary
     - natural language to candidate records
     - screenshot to candidate structured input
   - Do not jump to scheduled proactive AI pushes before the manual Today path and report aggregate layer are stable and bounded.

## Deferred But Useful

Keep these code paths hidden and annotated until the matching product/API job is ready:

- After the five-tab UI stabilizes, run a focused truncation pass for English and Chinese button labels, pills, and compact rows across Today, Record, Medicine, Report, and Mine.
- Sleep entry shapes.
- Lightweight mood record shapes.
- Environment signals for contextual Today/Mine use.
- Medicine scan/OCR/photo/barcode/prescription action shapes.

Pregnancy/lactation/special-group medication safety remains active only inside Medicine safety boundaries.

## Do Not Start Yet

- Standalone More tab or generic utility hub.
- Women-health or period management.
- Sport recovery.
- Specialist health packs.
- Smart devices or family profiles.
- Skin recognition or report photo import.
- OCR/barcode/photo/prescription recognition UI or contracts.
- Real push delivery through FCM/APNs.
- Real SMS delivery.
- Backend reminder delivery workers.
- Paid or credentialed external services without explicit approval.
- Environment frontend wiring until the target Today/Mine job is explicit.
