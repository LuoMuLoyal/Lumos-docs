# Lucent Docs

Last updated: 2026-06-30

This directory keeps the authoritative backend runtime, deployment, generated-contract, and shared data-contract documentation for Lucent. If a complex backend task needs a live execution plan, put it under `../plans/` instead of `docs/`.

## Document Boundaries

## Admin Panel

`/admin` is powered by AdminJS with the `@sergiyiva/adminjs-prisma` adapter.
Resources are generated automatically from `prisma/schema.prisma` at runtime, so
adding a new Prisma model and regenerating the client is enough to surface it in
the admin panel. Model-specific overrides (navigation group, list/show/filter
fields, hidden fields, title property, sort order, enum picklists) are declared
in `src/admin/adminjs.setup.ts`.

By default every resource supports full CRUD. Sensitive scalar fields such as
`passwordHash`, `refreshTokenHash`, `pushToken`, and `rawProfile` are hidden,
and all relation fields are hidden so only foreign-key scalars are exposed in
forms.

Product direction and current product state are owned by the workspace path `Luminous/docs/`.

## Relationship With `Lumos-docs`

`Lumos-docs/` is a separate showcase documentation site. It mirrors content from `Lucent/docs/` and `Luminous/docs/` for browsing convenience, but it **is not the source of truth** and is updated more slowly than the repo docs.

- Treat `Lucent/docs/` and `Luminous/docs/` inside each repo as the authoritative reference.
- Do not edit `Lumos-docs/` copies by hand to keep them "in sync"; the site should consume repo docs through its build pipeline.
- If you find a discrepancy, trust the repo-local doc and open a site ingestion issue instead of patching the mirror.

## Rules

- Do not maintain hand-written endpoint docs or API mock documents.
- Do not edit `openapi.json` manually.
- Active repo-local execution plans belong in `Lucent/plans/`; move durable decisions into the owning docs after completion, then delete the plan file.
- Keep old implementation plans out of active docs after their decisions move into the owning document.
- **When a follow-up item in `TODO.md` is completed, delete it from `TODO.md`; do not mark it complete there.** Move the resulting current-state facts to `Luminous/docs/Current_State.md`, record the change in the daily `Luminous/docs/migration-log/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and also record the completion in today's `Lucent/docs/migration-log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` as cross-repo sync evidence.
- Repo helper scripts under `scripts/` and `deploy/` are not part of the Nest app ESLint surface; validate them by running the relevant command instead of forcing app-only lint rules onto opened tool files.
