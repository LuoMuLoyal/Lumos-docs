# Data Sources

Last updated: 2026-06-27

## Target Directory

Local external data directory:

```text
DrugDataBase
```

This directory is not tracked by Git and must not be packaged into Flutter.

## Current Sources

- `FullDrugDetail.xlsx`: raw Chinese medicine product catalog (product metadata, sparse instruction fields).
- `药品说明书数据库_医药数据查询/`: raw scraped Chinese medicine leaflets from yaozs.com (rich instruction text, sparse product metadata).
- `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`: **recommended CN source for Lucent as of 4.0.0**. Built by `DrugDataBase/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/build_master_v2.py` from the two sources above. Each product row links to the best matched instruction via `best_instruction_id`; instruction text is no longer flattened into the product row. V1 (`ChineseDrugData_Master.xlsx`) is kept as an archived reference and should not be used for new imports.
- DrugBank files: English scientific enrichment source, including XML, CSV, FASTA, and SDF assets.

## Practical Import Workflow

1. Build the CN master file first:
   ```powershell
   cd ../DrugDataBase
   .venv/Scripts/python ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/build_master_v2.py
   # or on msys bash: .venv/bin/python ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/build_master_v2.py
   ```
   This produces `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`, which is the preferred source for `cn-products` import. The V1 `build_cn_master.py` output is archived and no longer used.
2. `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx` can be imported with GUI tools such as DBeaver for quick raw/staging load or spot-check import. V1 (`ChineseDrugData_Master.xlsx`) is archived and should not be used for new imports.
3. `drug links.csv`, `all.csv`, and `pharmacologically_active.csv` can also be handled by DBeaver or regular PostgreSQL CSV import flows.
4. `full database.xml` should not be treated as a manual GUI import. It is about 1.9 GB after unzip and should be parsed by an idempotent script into normalized tables.
5. Do not convert `full database.xml` to `xlsx` as a normal workflow. `xlsx` adds a row/column flattening step, size overhead, Excel/DBeaver cell limits, and loses the benefit of streaming the XML incrementally.
6. Lucent now has durable destination tables for both sources. Tool-based import is acceptable for the Chinese master source, but the DrugBank XML path should stay scripted so we can reproduce it.

## Scripted Import Commands

Recommended local preparation:

1. Build `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx` (see [CN Master Build](#cn-master-build)).
2. `pnpm dev:stack`
3. `pnpm db:migrate`
4. `pip install -r scripts/import/medicine/requirements.txt` if the Chinese master source is still `.xlsx`

Default scripted import order:

```bash
pnpm import:medicine:all
```

This runs:

1. `drugbank-drugs`
2. `drugbank-links`
3. `drugbank-targets-all`
4. `drugbank-targets-active`
5. `cn-leaflets`
6. `cn-products`
7. `cn-product-leaflet-links`

Why this order:

- `drugbank_external_links` depends on `drugbank_drugs.drugbank_id`.
- `drugbank_drug_targets` depends on both imported DrugBank drugs and imported target rows.
- `cn_medicine_product_leaflet_links` depends on both `cn_medicine_products` and `cn_medicine_leaflets`, so it runs last.

Chinese source notes:

- The default source for all CN commands is `../DrugDataBase/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`.
- `cn-products` reads sheet `ProductsEnriched`.
- `cn-leaflets` reads sheet `InstructionsClean`.
- `cn-product-leaflet-links` reads both `ProductsEnriched` (for product id mapping and best-match metadata) and `ProductInstructionLinks` (exact-code candidates), then guarantees a best-match link for every product regardless of whether it was matched by `exact_code` or `fuzzy_name`.
- If you need to override, pass `--source <path>` to the import command.

Smoke-test example:

```powershell
node scripts/import/medicine/import-medicine-datasets.ts --limit 20 --with-hash
```

Useful options:

- `-Command cn-products` or `-Command drugbank-drugs` to run one dataset only.
- `-SourcePath <file>` to override the default file for a single dataset import (for `cn-products`, this overrides `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`).
- `-NodeEnv test` to target the test database intentionally.
- `-BatchSize 250` to tune upsert batch size.
- `-SourceVersion 2026-05-30` to persist the export/version string into `drug_source_imports.source_version`.
- `-WithHash` to store a SHA-256 file hash in `drug_source_imports.source_file_hash`.

Import batches are deduplicated by the target table conflict key before upsert. This keeps smoke and full imports idempotent when a source file emits multiple rows for the same durable record, such as repeated DrugBank primary ids in the XML stream.

Chinese source note:

- `scripts/import/medicine/parsers/cn_products.py` supports both `.xlsx` and `.csv`.
- If `openpyxl` is not available, export `FullDrugDetail.xlsx` sheet `总的` to CSV and pass `--source` / `-Command cn-products` with that CSV path.

## Medicine Data Strategy

Lucent keeps the Chinese and English medicine datasets separate at query time. The two sources describe different things:

- English source (DrugBank XML/CSV): scientific drug entities, identifiers, mechanisms, pharmacology, targets, and interactions. This is the default medicine knowledge source for the personal health copilot.
- Chinese source (`ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`): Chinese market medicine products linked to package insert text, with quality scores and candidate metadata. This is the locked regional execution source for Chinese product/package lookup and CN leaflet RAG in 4.0.0.

Do not force both sources into one canonical medicine table in Phase 1. Matching Chinese products to DrugBank drug entities is a later enrichment task because one Chinese product can map to multiple active ingredients, and one DrugBank drug can map to many brands/products.

The two datasets do not have the same field model. Lucent should handle this with two layers:

1. A small common response layer for search lists and generic detail headers.
2. A source-specific detail payload that preserves each dataset's native fields.

Do not invent empty columns just to make `cn_medicine_products` and `drugbank_drugs` look identical. Missing or irrelevant source fields should stay absent from the source-specific payload.

Recommended durable tables after staging:

| Table                               | Purpose                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cn_medicine_products`              | One row per Chinese product/specification from `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`.                                |
| `cn_medicine_leaflets`              | One row per cleaned yaozs instruction from `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`.                                    |
| `cn_medicine_product_leaflet_links` | Product-to-leaflet links with match type, approval code, and match score from `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx`. |
| `medicine_leaflet_chunks`           | Chunked leaflet text for RAG; empty until the rebuild-leaflet-index pipeline runs.                              |
| `drugbank_drugs`                    | One row per primary DrugBank drug entry from `full database.xml`.                                               |
| `drugbank_external_links`           | External identifiers and consumer links from `drug links.csv` plus XML external identifiers/links.              |
| `drugbank_targets`                  | Target/polypeptide rows from `all.csv` or `pharmacologically_active.csv`.                                       |
| `drugbank_drug_targets`             | Many-to-many relationship between DrugBank drugs and target rows.                                               |
| `drug_source_imports`               | Import run metadata: source name, version/export date, file hash, row counts, rejection summary.                |

These durable tables now exist in Lucent's Prisma schema and migration history, even though the real source data has not been imported yet.

Optional later table:

| Table                     | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `medicine_source_matches` | Reviewed mapping between `cn_medicine_products` and `drugbank_drugs`, with match method and confidence. |

## RAG Knowledge Sources

Medicine RAG currently uses chunked Chinese package-insert text from `cn_medicine_leaflets`. The chunks are produced by `scripts/import/medicine/rebuild-leaflet-index.ts` and stored in `medicine_leaflet_chunks`. The assistant retrieves them via `get_medicine_leaflet_context`, which first resolves a `cn_medicine_products` row and then reads linked leaflet chunks. This keeps retrieval tied to a concrete, approved product label.

### Evaluated but not-yet-integrated source: 医疗问答数据集

- **Location:** `DrugDataBase/医疗问答数据集一共135万条/数据集/alpaca_zh_demo.json`
- **Size:** ~1.83 GB, ~1.36 million records
- **Format:** JSON array of Alpaca-style objects: `{ "id": "DX_N", "instruction": "问题", "output": "回答" }`
- **Status:** available on disk, not imported into PostgreSQL, not indexed for RAG.

Why it is different from leaflet RAG:

- Leaflets are official package inserts tied to a product; the Q&A set is generic medical question/answer content of unknown provenance.
- The current retrieval tool is product-first; the Q&A set is open-domain and would need a separate retrieval path (e.g., a `medical_qa_chunks` table + semantic search).
- Many answers contain diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Using them verbatim would cross the project's medical red line.

**Boundaries if integrated in the future:**

1. **Scope restriction:** only use it for general health education, symptom explanations, and "when to see a doctor" guidance. Exclude diagnosis, prescription, dosage, and treatment plans.
2. **Content filtering:** pre-filter or tag records; drop or block high-risk categories.
3. **Disclaimer:** every answer sourced from this dataset must be labeled as reference-only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
4. **Human review:** treat the dataset as unverified; do not present it as authoritative.
5. **Separate table:** do not mix Q&A chunks with leaflet chunks; keep distinct `source_kind` and retrieval logic.
6. **Legal/compliance review:** confirm with legal/product before enabling user-facing retrieval.

As of 4.0.0, `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx` is the locked CN source for both structured product lookup and leaflet RAG. The data fusion pipeline is frozen for 4.0.0; further improvements (DrugBank bridging, product aggregation, English translation) are scheduled for 4.x.

## Chinese Source Mapping

Import `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx` sheets into Lucent-owned durable tables:

- `ProductsEnriched` -> `cn_medicine_products`
- `InstructionsClean` -> `cn_medicine_leaflets`
- `ProductInstructionLinks` -> `cn_medicine_product_leaflet_links`

These sheets are produced by `DrugDataBase/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/build_master_v2.py`, which merges:

- `FullDrugDetail.xlsx` product catalog fields.
- The cleaned instruction rows from `药品说明书数据库_医药数据查询/` (yaozs.com leaflets).

Product-level fields come from `FullDrugDetail.xlsx`; canonical instruction text comes from the cleaned yaozs rows. When no instruction matches a product, the product row still exists in `cn_medicine_products`, but it will have no linked rows in `cn_medicine_product_leaflet_links`.

| XLSX column               | `cn_medicine_products` field | Notes                                                                               |

| `image_url`               | `image_url`                  | Keep source URL; proxy/cache decision remains separate.                             |
| `price`                   | `price_text`                 | Keep as text because values may be empty or non-normalized.                         |

| `match_quality_notes`     | `match_quality_notes`        | Quality notes as a JSONB array.                                                     |
| `drugbank_ids`            | `drugbank_ids`               | Optional DrugBank ids as a JSONB array.                                             |

In V2, `ProductsEnriched` no longer flattens matched instruction text into the product row. Structured instruction text lives in `cn_medicine_leaflets`, and `cn_medicine_products` only carries metadata (`best_instruction_id`, `best_match_type`, `match_quality_*`, `top_candidate_ids`, etc.) to select and rank leaflets. `overdose` has no yaozs counterpart and remains from `FullDrugDetail`.

| Field                       | Notes                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                        | Lucent UUID or generated stable id.                                                                                                            |
| `source_name`               | Constant such as `chinese_drug_data_master`.                                                                                                   |
| `source_row_number`         | Original row number for traceability.                                                                                                          |
| `search_text`               | Generated text for full-text search from name, brand, manufacturer, normalized manufacturer, approval number, barcode, and national drug code. |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | Lucent timestamps.                                                                                                                             |

Suggested uniqueness rules:

- Prefer `(approval_number, package_spec, manufacturer)` when `approval_number` exists.
- Fall back to `(name, package_spec, manufacturer, national_drug_code)` when approval number is missing.
- Keep apparent duplicates in staging and report them during import instead of silently dropping rows.

## CN Master Build (V2)

The canonical Chinese import source is generated, not hand-maintained. **4.0.0 locks the V2 fusion result; no further fusion-quality iterations are planned for this release.**

```powershell
cd ../DrugDataBase
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install openpyxl
.venv/Scripts/python ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/build_master_v2.py
```

On msys bash use `.venv/bin/python` instead of `.venv/Scripts/python`.

`build_master_v2.py` reads:

- `FullDrugDetail.xlsx` (product catalog)
- `药品说明书数据库_医药数据查询/*.xlsx` (yaozs leaflets)

and writes `ChineseDrugData_Master_V2/ChineseDrugData_Master_V2.xlsx` with these sheets:

| Sheet                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Summary`                 | Build metadata and counts.                                                                                                                   |
| `ProductsEnriched`        | One row per FullDrugDetail product, with `best_instruction_id` and quality metadata. This is the sheet imported into `cn_medicine_products`. |
| `OrphanInstructions`      | Instruction rows that did not match any product. Kept for future use, not imported in Phase 1.                                               |
| `InstructionsClean`       | All kept instruction rows in normalized English column names.                                                                                |
| `ProductInstructionLinks` | Exact-code product-instruction links with match type, match key, and text match score.                                                       |
| `FuzzyMatches`            | Fuzzy-name fallback matches (truncated to the first 100k rows in the `.xlsx`; full audit data must be exported separately if needed).        |
| `Conflicts`               | Instruction rows where `编号` and `批准文号` extracted disjoint approval codes.                                                              |
| `DroppedSummary`          | Low-value instruction rows dropped during build (empty or minimal content).                                                                  |

Key V2 improvements over V1:

- **Coverage:** instruction matching rose from ~56% to ~85.7% via fuzzy-name fallback.
- **Quality scores:** every product row carries `match_quality_*` fields so search/retrieval can rank exact matches above fuzzy matches.
- **Multiple candidates:** top-5 instruction candidates are retained per product.
- **Normalized manufacturers:** `manufacturer_normalized` improves matching and search.
- **Cleaned images:** placeholder image URLs are emptied.
- **DrugBank bridge:** optional `drugbank_ids` field for future scientific enrichment.

Cleaning rules applied during build:

- All text fields are whitespace-normalized and illegal Excel characters removed.
- Markers such as `尚不明确`, `无`, `null`, `重复资料` are treated as empty.
- Approval codes are extracted from both `编号` and `批准文号` using pattern `[A-Z]{1,3}/d{8}`. When the two fields disagree, `批准文号` is preferred and the row is flagged as `approval_conflict`.
- Product-instruction matching first uses approval code; unmatched products then fall back to fuzzy matching on generic name and normalized manufacturer.
- Instruction rows without approval codes and fewer than two meaningful leaflet fields are dropped as low value.

Producer name normalization **is** applied in V2 via suffix stripping (`有限公司`, `制药厂`, `药业`, etc.) and stored in `manufacturer_normalized`.

## DrugBank Source Mapping

Import `unziped/full database.xml` into a raw staging representation first, then normalize selected fields into `drugbank_drugs`.

FASTA and SDF files are not needed for Phase 1 search/detail. Keep them outside the database until a feature requires sequences or structures.

## Query Selection

Medicine APIs must select the source table explicitly from a frontend-provided medicine source parameter:

```text
source=cn       -> query cn_medicine_products
source=drugbank -> query drugbank_drugs
```

Do not use `Accept-Language` as the table selector. `Accept-Language` controls response messages and generic localization only. The medicine source controls which dataset is queried.

Default behavior:

- If `source` is missing, Lucent uses `drugbank` for medicine search/detail because the current product direction is personal health copilot knowledge-first.
- If `source=cn`, ids refer to `cn_medicine_products.id`.
- If `source=drugbank`, ids refer to `drugbank_drugs.drugbank_id`.
- Cross-source matching is not automatic. If a future detail page wants enrichment, it should use reviewed rows from `medicine_source_matches`.

## API Shape for Different Field Sets

Search responses should expose a common card shape so Flutter can render mixed or switched sources without knowing every source-specific field:

| Common field | `source=drugbank` value                         | `source=cn` value                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `drugbank_drugs.drugbank_id`                    | `cn_medicine_products.id`                   |
| `source`     | `drugbank`                                      | `cn`                                        |
| `name`       | English drug name                               | Chinese product name                        |
| `subtitle`   | CAS number, groups, or category summary         | Brand, package spec, or manufacturer        |
| `summary`    | Description or indication preview               | Indications or instructions preview         |
| `tags`       | Groups, categories, ATC snippets                | Drug type, main category, subcategory       |
| `imageUrl`   | Usually null unless a later source provides one | `image_url`                                 |
| `matchedBy`  | Name, synonym, identifier, target, etc.         | Name, brand, approval number, barcode, etc. |

Detail responses should use a discriminated union:

```json
{
  "id": "DB01050",
  "source": "drugbank",
  "name": "Ibuprofen",
  "subtitle": "CAS 15687-27-1",
  "detail": {
    "kind": "drugbank",
    "description": "...",
    "indication": "...",
    "mechanismOfAction": "...",
    "pharmacodynamics": "...",
    "drugInteractions": []
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "cn_...",
  "source": "cn",
  "name": "布洛芬缓释胶囊",
  "subtitle": "0.3g / 某某制药",
  "detail": {
    "kind": "cnProduct",
    "approvalNumber": "...",
    "manufacturer": "...",
    "packageSpec": "...",
    "indications": "...",
    "dosage": "...",
    "contraindications": "..."
  }
}
```

This keeps frontend rendering stable while letting each source keep its real schema.

## Ownership

- Lucent owns all imports, normalization, validation, and source mapping.
- PostgreSQL is the durable query source after import.
- Flutter only consumes Lucent APIs and may keep small user-owned offline cache snapshots.

## Import Rules

- Keep raw Chinese and DrugBank imports in separate staging tables first.
- Do not merge Chinese product records with DrugBank records until matching rules are reviewed.
- Use small fixtures for tests; do not run normal tests against the full xlsx or full XML.
- Import scripts must be idempotent and report source rows, imported rows, rejected rows, and sample rejection reasons.
- Import scripts should also stamp `drug_source_imports` with source file name, optional source version, optional SHA-256 hash, and batch-level rejection samples.
- Large files remain outside Git, generated dumps remain outside Git, and Flutter assets must not include these sources.

## Open Decisions

- DrugBank licensing and which fields can be used in user-facing responses.
- Matching strategy between Chinese products and DrugBank drugs.
- Whether image URLs should be proxied, cached, or left as source references.
